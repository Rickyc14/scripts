# --decrypt
# Decrypt the file given on the command line (or STDIN if no file is specified) and write
# it to STDOUT (or the file specified with --output). If the decrypted file is signed, the
# signature is also verified. This command differs from the default operation, as it never
# writes to the filename which is included in the file and it rejects files that donâ€™t
# begin with an encrypted message.
